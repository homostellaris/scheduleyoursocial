</svelte:head>

<h2>Schedule Your Social is similar to other social planning apps like Doodle</h2>

<p>However we solve a slightly different use case to Doodle and differ in a few key ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Schedule Your Social aims to be as simple and quick to use as possible in contrast to Doodle which was more features but might take longer to arrive at a time for your social.</li>
	<li>Schedule Your Social only allows you to agree a date to meet, not a time.</li>
	<li>Schedule Your Social provides real-time updates so you don't need to refresh the page!</li>
	<li>Schedule Your Social is not a mobile app, its a web app, but it still works great on mobile.</li>
</ul>
