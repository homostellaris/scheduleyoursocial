    If you don't feel ready for the responsbility of hosting just yet or you
    just want to meet other people who enjoy board games, you might consider
    first attending a local board games meetup. You can find <a
      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/game_groups/"
      >a good list of meetups on Reddit at /r/boardgames</a
    >.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Plan Ahead</h2>

  <p>
    The key to a successful board games night is proper planning. Start by
    selecting a date and time that works for all your potential guests. Consider
    sending out invitations well in advance, either through traditional methods
    or digital invites.

  </Hero>

  <p>
    Keep in mind the number of players each game supports, and ensure you have
    enough games to accommodate everyone.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Choose the Right Games</h2>

  <p>
    A crucial aspect of hosting a board games night is selecting the right games
    that suit your guests' interests and preferences. Aim for a diverse mix of
    games, including strategic, party, cooperative, and trivia games. Some of
    our favorites here at Schedule Your Social are:

        >Ticket to Ride</a
      >
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The experts over at Board Game Geek also have<a

      >a ranked list you can check out</a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    However, don't shy away from introducing lesser-known games; you might
    discover a hidden gem that becomes a new favorite.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: Set the Ambiance</h2>

  <p>
    Create a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere for your guests. Arrange
    plenty of seating in the designated gaming area and ensure there's ample
    space for players to spread out their boards and game components. Consider
    dimming the lights and using candles or string lights to add a cozy and
    intimate touch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Immersion means hitting all the senses! So you could also play thematic
    music or sounds in the background. For example if for Ticket to Ride you
    might play some train sounds 🚂
  </p>

    allowfullscreen=""
    allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
    loading="lazy"
    title="Vintage train sounds"
  />

  <p>
    Keep the volume at reasonable level though, you want to be able to hear
    yourself (or your teammates) think when considering your next move 👂
  </p>

  <h2>Step 4: Food Ideas</h2>

  <p>
    No board games night is complete without delicious snacks and drinks to keep
    everyone energized and engaged. If you want to go the extra mile then make
    sure you to accommodate those unfortunate souls with dietary requirements!
  </p>
  <p>
    But hosting others is a lot of work as it is so we'd recommend you encourage
    people to bring their own drinks and snacks which makes sense because then
    they can pick their favourites themselves.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 5: Learn by Playing</h2>

  <p>
    Chances are at least someone you're playing with won't be familiar with one
    of the games so you'll need to help them learn in a fun and engaging way.
    One sure way to kill their enthusiasm is to start with a 10-minute monologue
    explaining every rule and edge case they might encounter. It's boring and
    they won't remember it all anyway.
    <a
      href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/09/study-shows-that-students-learn-more-when-taking-part-in-classrooms-that-employ-active-learning-strategies/"
      >Most people learn by doing</a
    >
    so we suggest a quick 2-minute explanation of the concept and win conditions
    before diving straight into a practice game.
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, a nice visual presentation of the rules can be easily
    digestible so you might consider watching a video explaining the game. There
    are some excellent YouTube channels such as <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheRulesGirl">The Rules Girl</a
    > that cover popular games.
  </p>
  <div style="margin: 1rem auto; text-align: center;">
    <iframe
      width="100%"
      height="333"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQVHkl8oQEU?si=rqgZbRAg3D772Gwa"
      title="YouTube video player"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
      allowfullscreen
    />
  </div>

  <h2>Step 6: The Role of the Host</h2>

  <p>
    As the host, it's your responsibility to keep the energy high and ensure
    everyone feels included. Be enthusiastic, engaging, and attentive to your
    guests' needs. Facilitate the flow of the games, help resolve any disputes,
    and keep the conversation light and enjoyable. Don't forget to participate
    in the games yourself and showcase your competitive spirit!
  </p>

  <h2>Step 7: Encourage Friendly Competition</h2>

  <p>
    While the primary goal of a board games night is to have fun, a bit of
    healthy competition can add excitement to the mix. Encourage players to
    strategize, make bold moves, and celebrate each other's successes. Remember,
    the best victories are those that are shared and celebrated together.
  </p>

  />

  <h2>Step 8: Embrace the Social Aspect</h2>

  <p>
    Board games night is not just about the games; it's also a chance to
    strengthen bonds and create lasting memories with friends and family.
    Encourage players to interact, share stories, and laugh together. Be open to
    starting discussions, sharing anecdotes, and discovering more about each
    other during the game breaks.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you don't yet know your fellow gamers that well you could break the ice
    by sharing your personality type or D&D class. You could even share one of
    these quizzes in advance and discuss each other's results as an ice breaker!

        >D&D class quiz</a
      >
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 9: Time Management</h2>

  <p>
    Ensure you allocate enough time for each game, especially if you plan to
    play multiple games throughout the evening. Some games can be shorter and
    take around 30 minutes, while others might extend to a few hours. Plan
    accordingly and be flexible with your schedule if the fun runs a bit longer
    than expected.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 10: Capture the Moments</h2>

  <p>
    A picture is worth a thousand words, and board games night is no exception.
    Take photos throughout the evening to immortalize the laughter, camaraderie,
    and epic game moments. Share these pictures with your guests afterward, as
    it's a wonderful way to reminisce about the fantastic time everyone had.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sharing on social media with a hashtag like #BobsBoardGameNight can be an
    easy way to share photos whilst showing off your hosting skills! <a
