    We need one-off donations to support a database migration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for clicking. This is a hobby project that I don't currently earn any
    money from and have put a lot of my own time into. Although I love this
    project and have many ideas for it I still have to justify the time
    investment to some extent.
  </p>
  <p>
    I recently learned that <a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a>, the
    serverless database service which Schedule Your Social relies on, is being
    discontinued and
    <a href="https://fauna.com/blog/the-future-of-fauna"
      >will cease operations on May 30th</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    It will probably take me about two days to migrate to another database
    service which isn't a trivial time investment as I work full time and am a
    father of two.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I can get $200 or more in donations I'll consider this worth the time and
    will also take that as a signal that people get value from this app and
    consider building some more features that I have in mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I get a few donations and its not close to $200 then I probably won't be
    doing the migration, at least not anytime soon, and will refund those
    donations which are made.
